<h1>How does this program work</h1>

<p>Utilize database section to establish your database connection, <mark>If your database password is empty enter a space</mark></p>
<p>For pages, you need to know how many pages you are going to create, and you will also need to specify the amount of column you want to add access to in your project</p>
<b>Note: the first column must be your ID, and be sure you typed the correct column name</b>

<p>All the columns are expected to allow strings, if you have double, int, enum, set, text, varchar, or char that excepts type of string then you should be okay</p>

<p>For login page this version only allows you to add login in system statically, add username and password which you are going to use to login in your project.</p>

<p>After generating the project, a zip file will be downloaded with your username on it. use Apache server to run the program</p>

<p>Happy Coding :)</p>
